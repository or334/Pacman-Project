You can\r\n * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling\r\n * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your\r\n * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.\r\n * \r\n * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.\r\n * \r\n * To render a Curve Shape you must first create a `Phaser.Curves.Curve` object, then pass it to\r\n * the Curve Shape in the constructor.\r\n * \r\n * The Curve shape also has a `smoothness` property and corresponding `setSmoothness` method.\r\n * This allows you to control how smooth the shape renders in WebGL, by controlling the number of iterations\r\n * that take place during construction. Increase and decrease the default value for smoother, or more\r\n * jagged, shapes.\r\n *\r\n * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#curve\r\n * @since 3.13.0\r\n *\r\n * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {Phaser.Curves.Curve} [curve] - The Curve object to use to create the Shape.\r\n * @param {number} [fillColor] - The color the curve will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.\r\n * @param {number} [fillAlpha] - The alpha the curve will be filled with.
