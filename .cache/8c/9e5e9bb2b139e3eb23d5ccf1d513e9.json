You can\r\n * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling\r\n * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your\r\n * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.\r\n * \r\n * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.\r\n * \r\n * When it renders it displays an ellipse shape. You can control the width and height of the ellipse.\r\n * If the width and height match it will render as a circle. If the width is less than the height,\r\n * it will look more like an egg shape.\r\n * \r\n * The Ellipse shape also has a `smoothness` property and corresponding `setSmoothness` method.\r\n * This allows you to control how smooth the shape renders in WebGL, by controlling the number of iterations\r\n * that take place during construction. Increase and decrease the default value for smoother, or more\r\n * jagged, shapes.\r\n *\r\n * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#ellipse\r\n * @since 3.13.0\r\n *\r\n * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [width=128] - The width of the ellipse. An ellipse with equal width and height renders as a circle.\r\n * @param {number} [height=128] - The height of the ellipse. An ellipse with equal width and height renders as a circle.\r\n * @param {number} [fillColor] - The color the ellipse will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.\r\n * @param {number} [fillAlpha] - The alpha the ellipse will be filled with.
