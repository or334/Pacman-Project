[GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_OUT]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_OUT}\r\n * 2. [GAMEOBJECT_OUT]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_OUT}\r\n * 3. [POINTER_OUT]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_OUT}\r\n * \r\n * With the top event being dispatched first and then flowing down the list. Note that higher-up event handlers can stop\r\n * the propagation of this event.\r\n *\r\n * @event Phaser.Input.Events#GAMEOBJECT_OUT\r\n * @since 3.0.0\r\n * \r\n * @param {Phaser.Input.Pointer} pointer - The Pointer responsible for triggering this event.\r\n * @param {Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject} gameObject - The Game Object the pointer moved out of.\r\n * @param {Phaser.Types.Input.EventData} event - The Phaser input event. You can call `stopPropagation()` to halt it from going any further in the event flow.\r\n */\r\nmodule.exports = 'gameobjectout';\r\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"083990bb9ec6b7ba11709b4d4b60742c","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
